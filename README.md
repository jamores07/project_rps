### What I learned

I wanted to focus on learning [Next.js](https://www.nextjs.org). Specifically I wanted to focus on dynamic page rendering server side

Since, by default, the `/app` directory runs on server side so I had to create a separate component to handle the _theme provider_, tell it to run on the client side `'use client'`, and import into the layout component in the _root_ of the `/app` directory.

**Providers.tsx**

```javascript
'use client'
import { ThemeProvider } from 'next-themes'

export default function Providers({ children }: { children: any }) {
    return <ThemeProvider attribute="class">{children}</ThemeProvider>
}
```

**layout.tsx**

```javascript
export default function RootLayout({
  children,
}: Readonly<{
  children: React.ReactNode;
}>) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body className={inter.className} style={{ position: 'relative', minHeight: '100vh' }}>
        <div className="flex flex-col items-center" style={{ padding: '20px' }}>
          <Providers>
            <main>{children}</main>
          </Providers>
        </div>
        {...}
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

### Continued development

- [] Adjust the "Rules" modal to render from the score card component
- [] Add a "Multiplayer Component" button to allow multiple users to play
- [] Add a "Leaderboard" component to display the top scores
- [] Update the "Rules" modal to display rules for each game
